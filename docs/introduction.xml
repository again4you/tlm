    <title>What is TLM?</title>
    <para>
        TLM is a daemon that handles user logins in a multi-user, multi-seat system by
        authenticating the users through PAM, and setting up, launching, and tracking user
        sessions.
    </para>
    <para>
        TLM daemon itself does not include any UI for interacting with
        the users; any such interaction is handled through TLM's authentication plugin system (see
            <link linkend="TlmAuthPlugin">TlmAuthPlugin</link>).
        TLM can be configured to log-in a default ("guest") user when no other
        user is logged in at a specific seat.
